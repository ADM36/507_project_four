* PROJECT NAME: Aaron's Simple Pong Game

#What does this program do?
This program executes and enables a one player game of "brick pong." When the game is executed, a player can control their paddle (a lightsaber) with the W and S keyboard keys. The objective of the game is for a player to deflect the three game balls (Togepi's) to the right hand side of the game board, hitting each white brick until all of the bricks are gone.

Some specifics of the game the player should know:
* To start and pause the game a player may use the P keyboard key
* Upon first launching the game, a player need to restart the game a few times, as the balls tend to have a mind of their own and may cause the game to freeze and break
* To have a ball hit a brick, a player should move their paddle up and down to stop the balls from going far enough left to pass by the paddle, and deflect the balls right to hit the white bricks
* The angle to witch the balls start moving from their point of origin is random, so all three balls should move different directions

#What additions did I make to this code, beyond the project asks?
* The paddle can move left, right, up and down
* Added three balls to the game
* Different image files for the balls and paddle
